### 👋 Hi, I’m @Inf0matics

I’m a freelance developer, maker, 3d printer and moderator with a passion for building useful tools at the intersection of hardware and software.
My main interests include automation, ESP devices, WLED, and open-source development. I enjoy creating tools that solve real-world problems in my own projects and sharing them with the community.

### 🚀 Featured Project

#### [WLED Pixel Studio](https://wps.tsp.tools)

A lightweight, browser-based pixel editor designed specifically for WLED matrix devices.
Design pixel art visually, preview it live, and send it directly to your WLED devices — no installation required.

**Features**

- Visual 2D pixel editor  
- Direct upload to WLED devices  
- Live preview  
- Browser-based — no installation needed  
- Fast and lightweight  

**Planned features**

- Home Assistant integration  
- Text rendering support  
- Animation workflows  
- Multi-device support  

The goal is to make WLED matrices easier to use, integrate, and automate in maker and smart home environments.

### 🔮 Vision

My current focus is expanding WLED Pixel Studio and bringing it directly into Home Assistant.

This will enable:

- Sending images directly to WLED devices from Home Assistant  
- Displaying dynamic text from automations  
- Creating visual smart home notifications  
- Supporting animations and advanced display workflows  

The goal is to make WLED matrices a fully integrated part of the smart home ecosystem.
